## Description
The OpenAI Agents SDK enables you to build agentic AI apps in a lightweight, easy-to-use package with very few abstractions.This AI Synchronous OpenAI SDK Agent demonstrates how to build a simple AI assistant by integrating Google‚Äôs Gemini API through an OpenAI-compatible interface Synchronously. It makes use of an Agent system, which is a modular design pattern that allows AI components to behave autonomously‚Äîprocessing inputs, following specific instructions, and generating intelligent responses.This means you can use familiar OpenAI-like syntax and logic, but with Gemini models under the hood.

##  üîÅ Why Use Synchronous Execution?

1. **Simplicity**  
   Synchronous code is easier to write, read, and debug. Each line executes in order, making the flow predictable.
2. **Step-by-Step Flow**  
   The code waits for each operation (like receiving the agent's response) to complete before moving to the next step.
3. **No Need for Concurrency**  
   For simple, single-threaded tasks like one-time prompts or input/output, synchronous execution is efficient and straightforward.

4. **Reliable Output Handling**  
   Using `Runner.run_sync()` ensures the model response is fully retrieved before it‚Äôs used or printed, avoiding incomplete outputs.

### Use-Cases

- ‚úÖ Command-line interface (CLI) tools  
- ‚úÖ Quick prototypes or demos  
- ‚úÖ Educational scripts and learning examples  
- ‚úÖ Single-user applications  
- ‚úÖ Testing or debugging model outputs  
- ‚úÖ Low-traffic tools that don‚Äôt require high performance

## Project Features

* ü§ñ **Custom AI Agent:** Built using the Agent and Runner pattern for modularity and scalability.
* üåê **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Integration:**  Utilizes Google's API for access to the powerful Gemini language model.
* üîë **Secure API Key Management:** Employs `python-dotenv` for safe and convenient API key handling.
* üß† **Dynamic Prompt Handling:**  Processes and responds effectively to a wide range of user prompts.
* ‚ö° **Asynchronous Communication:**  Leverages `AsyncOpenAI` for optimized asynchronous communication with OpenAI, improving speed and responsiveness.
* üêç **Clean Python Codebase:**  Maintained with a focus on readability, modularity, and best practices.


## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waheed444/OpenAI_SDK_Agent_02.git
cd OpenAI_SDK_Agent_02
```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**OR Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install openai-agents python-dotenv

```
4. **Set up `.env` file:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key:

```
GIMINI_API_KEY  =  your_actual_gemini_api_key_here 
```

**Note:** Replace `your_actual_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual Gemini API key.

More detailed usage instructions and example prompts will be provided in the project's documentation.
